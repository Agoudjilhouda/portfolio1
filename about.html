<h2>NOUR AGOUDJIL</h2>

<h3>HEY , i'm a front-end developper and a UI/UX designer with more than a 4 yeas experience , I use HTML & CSS (usually SASS) every day, and I try to keep up with the latest features while maintaining graceful degradation.

  I use JavaScript fairly often, usually with jQuery. I also run Node.js-based workflow automation via Gulp or Grunt for web projects , and i have written other Node scripts to automate mundane tasks.
  
  My main server-side language is PHP, quite often paired with MySQL. I usually use WordPress for client sites, depending on requirements. I specialize in custom themes, and have also built custom plugins for unique functionality.
   also im good in visualization tools such as InVision , sketch , figma , photoshop..
   I use Git for all of my programming work. Check out my GitHub page for random projects and contributions to other open source projects.I primarily use Visualcode text editor for coding.
